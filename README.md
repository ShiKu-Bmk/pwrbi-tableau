This repository contains Power BI and Tableau reports analyzing fictitious super stores and reports about a global chainstore. 

The organization demonstrates a complex, globally distributed business model with multifaceted sales and operational dynamics across several dimensions. Geographically, the company has a strong market presence in regions including APAC, United States, Canada, UK, and India, suggesting a robust international strategy with diverse revenue streams. Product performance varies significantly across categories, with some sub-categories like Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology generating substantially higher sales volumes compared to others, indicating potential opportunities for strategic product portfolio optimization.
The monthly and quarterly sales data reveal intricate patterns of fluctuation, highlighting potential seasonal variations and market volatility that require continuous monitoring and adaptive business strategies. Incident management appears to be a structured process, with multiple incident tiers tracked consistently, suggesting a sophisticated approach to operational challenges and quality control. Sales performance among employees shows considerable disparities, with certain individuals demonstrating significantly higher sales volumes, which could indicate differences in sales territories, individual capabilities, or targeted marketing strategies.
The visualizations across Power BI and Tableau dashboards provide granular insights into box shipments, sales volumes, geographical distribution, product performance, and operational incidents. Total sales across the analyzed periods amount to over $12.6 million, demonstrating a substantial business scale with potential for further growth and optimization. The data suggests the organization would benefit from continued strategic analysis, focusing on understanding regional market dynamics, optimizing product mix, developing sales talent, and maintaining robust incident management processes.
Employee performance tracking, geographical sales distribution, and detailed product category analysis emerge as critical components of the organization's data-driven decision-making approach. The consistent use of advanced business intelligence tools like Power BI and Tableau indicates a commitment to comprehensive, data-informed management strategies.
